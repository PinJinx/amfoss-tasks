## Task 4: Gopal and his PagePal

### Overview
I have implemented all the required commands as outlined in the task. The bot is named **@Page_palBot**. If you have difficulty finding it through search, I’ve also provided a QR code for easy access. I’ve ensured that all user data, such as the reading list, is stored within individual sessions, making it unique to each user. The bot has been thoroughly tested, and I believe it meets all the specified requirements.

### My Thoughts
Before undertaking this task, I assumed that creating Telegram bots was a complex process that required large servers. However, this task demonstrated that even a small laptop can be used to create bots. There are numerous easily accessible APIs and libraries available for bot development, making the process much more approachable. It took me nearly two days to complete this task, and it was an excellent learning experience.
