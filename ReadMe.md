## Introduction

Hi, I am Rohith K Pradeep from the Computer Science department. I'm currently in my 1st semester at this college. To tell you a bit about myself, one of my hobbies that I started during the corona pandemic was learning game design. I taught myself and it got me more interested in coding. Over the years, I've picked up a few languages and frameworks like HTML, CSS, C#, and Python.

Then, as the pandemic ended and my 11th and 12th grade began, I participated in a lot of hackathons and other competitions (by a lot, I mean 6 to 7 contests, not a huge number). Through these programs, I started learning other aspects of computing, like Arduino, at an intermediate level. All of these experiences solidified my desire to pursue computer science, which is why I'm here and chose the computer department.

## Why Should We Choose You?

If you ask me why the club should choose me, I would say that over the last two years (my 11th and 12th grade), I've learned a lot about myself, thanks to all the hackathons and contests I attended. One of the main things I learned is how dedicated I am. If I'm committed to completing a task or competing in a contest for the club, I will absolutely put my heart and soul into it. Whether it means staying up late or learning new things I don't even have a basic understanding of, I will give my best effort in everything that comes my way.

Second, I love learning. Back in my 6th or 7th grade, when my friends made fun of me for not knowing what a game engine was, I became curious. Within the next two years, I learned two completely different engines and made 5 to 6 games. If I set my mind to it, I can learn anything you throw at me.

## How Do You Intend to Contribute Back to the Club?

By joining the club, my main goal is to learn new things and experiment with new technologies. I'll always be ready to learn and teach my fellow members. I would gladly participate in club events and competitions. If I get the chance, I'll happily represent the club and participate in contests with full enthusiasm.

## What Are Your Fields of Interest, and How Do You Plan on Working on Them?

While game design is an interest, I don't want to limit myself solely to that. My plan is to learn a variety of things, from web development to the current hype in the market, AI. From basic languages like Python to complex ones, I want to have a taste of all of them. With all that being said, I do have a roadmap for self-improvement.

Firstly, I want to focus on mastering the major programming languages like C++, C, Java, etc. Additionally, I'm keen on learning new applications like Flutter. Whether it's for a contest or not, I aim to learn all the essential languages and skills needed to land a good job by the end of my four years.

**P.S.:** I tried to format this like a job interview.
