### Introduction ###
One of the most anoying aswell as interesting task for me was the hero dex task.The main objective of that task was to create an android app using flutter that reads data from a json file and displays each hero and thier descriptions.
I tried to do the task inside both vs code and android studio and managed to get flutter working only inside android studio.I had completed the task in about 3-4days and the last two days were the most intersting days.

###Basic Structure###
Main Branch
|
--lib
|  |
|  ---Pages
|      |
|      ---Dart files(I placed my dart files for each page in this)
|
--Assets
   |
   ---- Icons(this Stored pictures)
   |
   ---- Json(data for heros)


###Technical Details###
I started doing my task with a youtube video as it was partially related to my topic and helped me get an hang of flutter. Because of this I had my codebase organised as different files.The program will execute in main.dart file that fetches the json file and calls another file named HomePage.darthings in the application tt this file mainly managed all of the ui and backend of the application.After ensuring the data is fetched from json this file draws the ui and will start initialising Name and icon of each hero stored inside a container inside a grid view. Each container also contains a button with a heart icon that tracks and stores a list of faviorite heros whenever the user interacts with the button. The user can then display all of his faviorite heros with the heart icon inside the search bar.Apart from this there is also another button in the search bar with a moon icon that toggles Dark and Light mode.

##My Expirience with the task###
The day i started the task i had decided to do it inside vscode.To do so i seached it up and found i had to install and extract some jdks and sdks.On my first attempt it gave me an error saying sdk was not found.I sorted out the problem and then i stated saying some other module was not installed.I tried a lot and whenever i fix a bug related to installing or configuring a module a new one pops up.At last i got so fed up i decided to use android studio.Setting up android studio for flutter was a much easier task.I got it setup and i had started on with my project.For the basics i started with a youtube video.It just helped me to create a framework and complete the basic front end like search bar and buttons.The remaining tasks like fetching up of json and displaying the information was done with the help of google.One i had the task started it was really fun figuring it out and it gave me a pleasure when everthing piece of the puzzle started coming together.

##My thoughts on the task###
This task was really interesting.It was similar to any modern day game engine since i had expirence using unity i had no problem in adapting.In my opinion this task was really perfect as there were a lot of guides and tutorials related to flutter.Any biginner could pickit up even though it looks like a Mountain at the beggining once we get the basic idea rest is smooth sailing
