##Task 3:Hello World

Although this task took some time, I have completed it. It showed me how other languages like Java, C#, and C++ work. This task also taught me the depth that some of these languages go into to perform simple tasks, especially Haskell. I had no problem completing the subtasks in languages like Java, C#, C++, and Python, but for languages like Haskell, Ruby, and Elixir, it took a bit more time.
