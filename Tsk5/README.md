## Task 5: Terminal Trolley

### Instructions
To run the page, either serve `index.html` on a server or simply open it in your browser.

Please note that both the add and remove functions will only add or remove an item if it is listed in the terminal. My roommate initially tested the website without listing an item, so I wanted to remind you of this. Additionally, since I used the same CSS file for both web pages, it may appear messy. Just keep in mind that if a class contains an 'H' in its name, it is intended for `BuyPage.html`.

### Technical Details
I have divided the task into two separate parts: the main page and the buy page. `styles.css` is the CSS file that controls the styling for both pages. The buy page works with `BuyPage.html` and `BuyPageScript.js`, whereas the main page, which handles most of the tasks, runs with `index.html` and `script.js`. I have tried to replicate the video as closely as possible, but I also made a few adjustments here and there.

### Things That Don’t Work
- The navbar does not function as it was just a placeholder in the demo video. After inquiring, I was told to leave it as is.
- The buy button does not work since there’s nothing for it to redirect to.
- The calculation for tax is just 8% of the total and serves only as a sample.

*Also, I apologize for the messiness of the code. Sorry for any inconvenience.*
