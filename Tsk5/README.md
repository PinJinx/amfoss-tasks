# TerminalTrolly
Not much to say about this task
I had taken some liberty to change some backdrops that I felt doesnot fit the "vibe" rest is same as video

## Things that dont work
->Please note that the navbar doesnot work as it was just just a placeholder in demo video and i had enquired and had been told just leave it be
->Buy button doesnot work as there nothing there to redirect to
->Calculation for tax is just 8% of total it is just a sample

## Instructions
->To run the page either run index.html in a server or just open it in your browser
->Kindly Note that both add and remove functions will only add or remove an item if it is listed in the terminal as my roomate first did this to test the website without listing item I just thought to remind this here.
->Since i used same css file for both web page it is a mess just keep in mind if class contain 'H' in name it is for BuyPage.html
