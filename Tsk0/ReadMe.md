## Successfully Dual-Booting Linux Ubuntu

I successfully dual-booted Linux Ubuntu alongside my existing operating system without any hassle. The installation process was smooth and straightforward, and I had no issues configuring the boot loader or partitioning the drives. Everything worked seamlessly from the start and I didnot had any problems configuring it.
